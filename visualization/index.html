                    <p>"Metal bands: they have cool names." That is more or less the thesis of this essay.
                    </p>

                    <p>You may have noticed that some of these names are pretty bad. And you might also look at the extensive lists of bands with "death", "dark", etc. in name and wondered if all of the credible metal band names are exhausted.</p>
                    <p>To explore this further, we can use machine learning to automatically generate names based on the full list of band names.</p>

                      <dt>Devil's Killers</dt>
                      <dd>Arguably too cheesy for a metal band name. But it might be perfectly good for rockabilly/"psychobilly". It appears to have last been used for a <a href="https://groovyageofhorror.tumblr.com/post/112319345016/the-devils-killers">men's pulp magazine story</a>.</dd>

                      <dt>Embrace the Sins</dt>
                      <dd>A sensible admonition.</dd>

                      <dt>Satanic Empire</dt>
                      <dd>Another band has a demo CD called "<a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Fields_of_the_Filthy/Hymns_to_the_Satanic_Empire/277377">Hymns to the Satanic Empire</a>". But no band called this yet; why?</dd>

                      <dt>Dead Painful</dt>
                      <dd>Sounds like a sixth member of the Sex Pistols, but could also make for a decent British metal band name.</dd>

                      <dt>Killing Heaven</dt>
                      <dd></dd>

                      <dt>Car on Grave</dt>
                      <dd>"just put my car on my grave"</dd>

                      <dt>The Vaginal Gore Curse</dt>
                      <dd>We have taught the machine to be unpleasant.</dd>

                      <dd>"All your life, you've been a cereal inventor. Make a good one for me when I die."</dd>
